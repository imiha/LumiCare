# Technical Architecture

## Backend (Express + SQLite)

- **DB layer:** `sql.js` (pure JavaScript SQLite — no native compilation required)
- Schema: `patients`, `staff`, `services`, `appointments` tables (seeded with demo data)
- REST API on port 3000; CORS allowed for `localhost:4200`
- Persistence: DB file at `backend/db/clinique.db`; saved to disk after every write

## Frontend (Angular 18)

- Standalone components throughout (no NgModules)
- Signals for reactive local state (`signal()`, `computed()`, `effect()`)
- `HttpClient` via `provideHttpClient()` in `app.config.ts`
- SCSS with CSS custom properties for the clinic theme (dark navy + gold)
- Lazy-loaded routes: `/patients`, `/appointments`, `/staff`

# Verification Checklist

- [ ] `cd backend && npm install && node server.js` → health check at `http://localhost:3000/api/health` returns `{status:"ok"}`
- [ ] `ng serve` → app loads at `http://localhost:4200`
- [ ] Patient Intake: register a new patient → appears in list → edit medical history → saves
- [ ] Appointments: book appointment → conflict detection blocks double-booking → cancel appointment
- [ ] Staff Dashboard: today's cards show seeded appointments → alert visible for session starting soon
